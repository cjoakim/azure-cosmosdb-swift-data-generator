# azure-cosmosdb-swift-data-generator

Data generator for **Project Swift**.

## Purpose

Create simulated **mongoexport** files for loading into MongoDB for migration testing.

---

## Public Datasets used in this Repo

- https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/
  - Download the [2021 – comma-delimited version [Baseball Databank] zip file](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank/archive/refs/tags/v2022.2.zip)

This public data is augmented with some random values using the Python [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/).

### Attribution

The generated documents will each contain a "source_data_attribution" attribute, populated as follows: 

```
"source_data_attribution": "https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/",
```

## User Instructions

### System Requirements

- Windows 11, Linux, or macOS operating system
- Python 3
- Disk space sufficient for creating large datasets; 1GB or more is recommended.

### Clone this GitHub Repository

```
> git clone https://github.com/cjoakim/azure-cosmosdb-swift-data-generator.git
> cd azure-cosmosdb-swift-data-generator
```

### Download the Public Datasets

Download the above **2021 – comma-delimited version [Baseball Databank] zip file**
to directory **sourcedata/seanlahman/** in this repo.  Then unzip the file.

See file **seanlahman-baseballdatabank-files-list.txt** in this repo; after exploding
the downloaded zip file these files should exist on your system.

Confirm that file **sourcedata/seanlahman/baseballdatabank-2022.2/core/Batting.csv**
is present relative to the GitHub repo root directory on your computer.  This will
ensure that the csv files are in the correct location for the code in this repo.
You may have to copy the files up one directory.

### Setup and Activate the Python Virtual Environment

A Python Virtual Environment (i.e. - venv) specifies a version of Python and a set of
libraries to use within that environment.  You can have multiple virtual environments
on your computer.

The list of libraries is typically specified in a **requirements.in** or **requirements.txt**
file.

In this repo there are two scripts that can be executed to setup the Virtual Environment
for this project.  These are **venv.ps1** (Windows PowerShell) and **venv.sh** (bash, for Linux & macOS).
Execute the appropriate script.

See the comments at the end of these scripts which show how to **activate** the Virtual Environment
so that it will be used.

#### Activate Virtual Environment On Windows

```
> .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Activate Virtual Environment On Linux and macOS

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

### Edit and Execute the Generate Scripts

These are **generate-baseball-data.ps1** (Windows PowerShell) and **generate-baseball-data.sh** (Bash, Linux & macOS).

The generated files are in **mongoexport/mongoimport** file format, and are located in the
**data/** directory of this repo.  These files are git-ignored.

#### On Windows

```
> .\generate-baseball-data.ps1
```

#### On Linux and macOS

```
$ ./generate-baseball-data.sh
```

### Sample Script

Both of the above scripts have lines like the following.  The values 50000 and 1000 refer to the
number of smaller and jumbo documents that will be generated, respectively.  Edit these counts
per the needs of your dataset.  At least one 2MB+ jumbo document will be generated.

```
python main.py create_baseball_base_mongoexport_files

python main.py create_baseball_large_document_count_data 50000

python main.py create_baseball_large_document_size_data 1000
```

## Sample Data 

There are 28 files in the seanlahman Baseball Databank.  This project creates
each as a mongoexport/mongoimport file.

Additionally, two files are created to create both **many documents** (i.e. - over 1-million)
as well as **jumbo documents** (i.e - up to 2MB and beyond).  These two files focus on Player
data that looks like the following for Roberto Clemente.

The **notes** array is random text created by the Faker library.


```
$ cat data/baseball_core_People.json | head -3347 | tail -1 | jq

{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6280fbc7b1cb828ff3d743c8"

  ],

  "_asz": 1057,
  "_generated_at": "2022-05-15T13:10:31.710461+00:00"
}
```

The **_asz** attribute represents approximate size of the document in bytes.
